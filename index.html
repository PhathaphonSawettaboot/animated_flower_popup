            Just a little note to say you're doing an amazing job. I know the kitchen is super busy and you're juggling a million things, but you're handling it like the amazing head chef you are! 🍳👨‍🍳
            
            I see how hard you work and all that you carry on your shoulders. It's like you're cooking up a storm of success, and I'm so proud of you for that. Remember, even the best chefs need to take a break and taste their own fishies! So, don't forget to breathe and take a moment for yourself. You more than deserve it.
            
            And thank you... for every little moment you share with me. Even when your days are packed, you still find time for us. That means the world to me. 🌎❤️
            
            You might feel like quitting sometimes, but guess what? You're tougher than the toughest kitchen challenge. You've got this secret ingredient of strength and I believe in you, always.
            
            Keep cooking up greatness, but also remember to rest. You're my favorite chef, my best friend, and my hero all rolled into one.
            
            With all my love and more, your monster</div>
